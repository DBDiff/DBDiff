## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within DBDiff, please send an e-mail to **hello@akalsoftware.com**. 

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed. Please do not report security-related issues through the public GitHub Issue tracker, as this exposes the vulnerability to the public before a fix can be prepared.

### What to expect

After reporting a vulnerability:
1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. We will provide a timeline for a fix, typically within 7-14 days depending on the severity.
3. Once the fix is prepared and tested, we will release a new version and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep DBDiff secure!
